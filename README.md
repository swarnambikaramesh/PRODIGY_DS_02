# Salary Prediction Project

# Project Overview

This project aims to predict salaries based on age and rating using linear regression. The dataset used contains information about age, salary range, rating, location, establishment year, and whether easy apply is available. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are performed before building the prediction model.

# Dataset

The dataset is named `salaryage.csv` and contains the following columns:
- `Index`: Index of the record
- `Age`: Age of the individual
- `Salary`: Salary range in the format "$xxk-$yyk"
- `Rating`: Rating value
- `Location`: Location in the format "City, State"
- `Established`: Year the entity was established
- `Easy Apply`: Indicates if easy apply is available

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- `salaryage.csv`: The dataset file.
- `main.py`: The main script containing data cleaning, EDA, model training, and prediction.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
